                                <hr/>
                                <p>After researching the origins of Neapolitan Pizza, the idea of designing a special cutlery especially for pizza came up and Funiculi' is the result. <br> Funiculì is a new piece of cutlery made of a single piece of spring steel. The material allows it to bend and be folded, so after you are done cutting it with it you can grab your slice and eat eat it. Pizza has to be eaten with your hands, but looks impolite to some; Funiculì allows to eat pizza with hands and cutlery at the same time. <br>
