                                <p>Holter heart monitoring portable device. The Holter monitoring device has to be worn for 24 hours by the patient. Usually the machine is bulky and limits the activity of the patient, making the data recorded not true to reality. The goal here was to create something completely wearable and with minimized dimensions. The advice for the internal components dimensions came from the Medical Engineering faculty research at Politecnico di Milano.<br> This project was developed for my BA Thesis.<br>
