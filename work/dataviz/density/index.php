                                <p>This work is the result of a great studio attended at Politecnico di Milano, Density Design, during which we have developed maps, information graphics starting from data and statistical documents.
We have analyzed poverty in Italy, then focusing on the city of Milan choosing one aspect of daily life that could be affected, and how, by poverty. In this case the aspect is the offer for the what the city offers for its citizen's leisure time.
In parallel we also worked on smaller project like analyzing and mapping the relationship of the three main characters of the movie, by F.Truffaut, Jules and Jim.<br>
